# Ego network analysis

The ego networks are used in social network science to describe the *relational identity* of the individual [[1]](#ref1). There is social cognitive science research that concludes that the self can be modelled in three components: *individual identity*, aspects of the self that are unique, *relational identity*, aspects of the self associated with other relevant individuals for the ego in the network, and *social identity*, definition of the self derived from one's membership in social groups.

We present here a way to construct an ego network for Twitter users, we analyse different aspects of these ego networks, as well as the network evolution through the COVID19 pandemic.

## Concepts

Given a user $u$, let's define:

- $O(u)$: Others of $u$. The set of users that receive 2 or more retweets from $u$.
- $R_u(o)$: Number of retweets that receives a users $o\in O(u)$ from $u$
- $P(R_u)=P(\{ R_u(o), \forall o \in O(u)\})$: Empiric distribution of $R_u(o)$ for all $o\in O(u)$.
- $O_s(u)=\{o\in O(u)| R_u(o)\in \text{Outliers}(P)\}\sub O(u)$: Significative others of $u$. The subset of users for which its number of retweets from $u$ represents an outlier of the $P(R_u)$ distribution

<figcaption>Fig.1 - Significative other definition.</figcaption>
</figure>

The significative others set ($O_s$) are the users that receive a significant larger amount of retweets than the rest of others. Could be that the significative others set is empty, and thus we don't have an ego network for that particular user.

For the definition of $\text{Outliers}$ we will use what is stated in the paper [[3]](#ref3), that introduces the skewness into the measurement of the outliers. With 
$$
Q_i := i\text{th quartile P} \\
IQR:=Q_3-Q_1\\
MC := \text{Medcouple(P)}
$$
We define:

$$
\text{Outliers}(P)=\{x|x\notin[Q_1 − h_l(MC) IQR; Q_3 + h_u(MC) IQR]\}\\
h_l(MC) = 1.5e^{-4MC}\\
h_u(MC) = 1.5e^{3MC}
$$
In our case we will only use the upper bound ($\text{OutlierFrontier}(P)=Q_3 + h_u(MC) IQR$), as we have a right long tail, with the most frequently retweeted profiles in the right. 

The *ego-significant-network* is the directed network having as nodes: the ego ($u$), and the outliers of its retweet distribution ($O_s(u)$). We will have an directed edge between $u$ and $v$ if $v\in O_s(u)$. Of course the ego    ($u$) will have outgoing edges to all the other nodes in the graph. For every outlier $o_i\in O_s(u)$, we find its outliers ($O_s(o_i)$), and if the $o_{o_i}\in O_s(u)\cup{u}$ we will add an edge from $o_i$ to $o_{o_i}=o_j\in O_s(u)\cup{u}$.

## Timeline networks analysis

We will construct a significant ego network for each timeline of all users, and we will look at overall properties of all the ego-networks generated by our users. As we don't have a balanced number of users for each type, we will apply a bootstrapping technique in order to compare the distributions. That means that we will pick a random subsample of the distribution of the same size for each user group, compare among them and compute the mean of the comparations. The plot of the variables associated with the networks of the users will be done in a similar fashion.

### Degree

The degree of the ego inside the network, so the total number of nodes of the network minus 1 (the ego). We can see how the politicians differ very much from the other groups.
$$
\text{Degree}(G_u)={\#G_u-1}
$$

**P-values for sampled Kolmogorov-Smirnov test **

|                     | journalist | politician | random-follower | random-friend |
| ------------------: | ---------: | ---------: | --------------: | ------------: |
|      **journalist** |   0.013974 |   0.275131 |        0.117046 |      0.060879 |
|      **politician** |   0.274419 |   0.041206 |        0.184481 |      0.257700 |
| **random-follower** |   0.118161 |   0.185019 |        0.008606 |      0.078555 |
|   **random-friend** |   0.060738 |   0.259250 |        0.078369 |      0.008491 |

If we fit a $\text{Gamma}$ distribution to the histograms of the different user types, we find the results plotted in $\text{Fig.4}$ and $\text{Fig.5}$.

<figure style="text-align:center">
    <iframe height='320' scrolling='no' src='https://bernatesquirol.github.io/tfm-plots/degrees-slider' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 99.99%;'></iframe>

    <figcaption>Fig.5 - Gamma fits plotted</figcaption>
</figure>


We can see how the plot of the fitted distributions look like in $\text{Fig.5}$. That means politicians tend to have more outliers than the other user types. We can also see that the QQ-plots in journalists and random users are very similar, the $\text{Gamma}$ distribution fails in similar ways.

### Reciprocity

We define the reciprocity as the number of outliers that have edges towards the ego divided by the amount of outliers.
$$
\text{Reciprocity}(G_u)=\frac{\#\{v\in{(G_u-u)}|(v,u)\in \text{Edges}(G_u)\}}{\#G_u-1}
$$

    <figcaption>Fig.6 - Ego reciprocity by type.</figcaption>
</figure>

**P-values for sampled Kolmogorov-Smirnov test**

|                 | journalist | politician | random-follower | random-friend |
| --------------: | ---------: | ---------: | --------------: | ------------: |
|      journalist |   0.010489 |   0.105550 |        0.040881 |      0.105750 |
|      politician |   0.103113 |   0.034175 |        0.132675 |      0.157906 |
| random-follower |   0.040887 |   0.130812 |        0.006023 |      0.125938 |
|   random-friend |   0.105946 |   0.157087 |        0.125920 |      0.007257 |

We see no clear differences between reciprocity in each type of user, as nearly $80$% of the users don't have reciprocity at all from their outliers. That proportion is a bit lower with politicians.

### Connections between outliers

We define the outlier connectedness as the number of edges between outliers, divided by the number of possible edges between outliers.
$$
\text{OutlierConnectedness}(G_u)=\frac{\#\{v\in (G_u-{u})|\exist w\in (G_u-{u}),(v,w)\in \text{Edges}(G_u)\}}{(\#G_u-1)\times(\#G_u-2)}
$$

**P-values for sampled Kolmogorov-Smirnov test **

|                     | journalist | politician | random-follower | random-friend |
| ------------------: | ---------: | ---------: | --------------: | ------------: |
|      **journalist** |   0.016117 |   0.469709 |        0.121097 |      0.059129 |
|      **politician** |   0.469169 |   0.048047 |        0.558213 |      0.488959 |
| **random-follower** |   0.120751 |   0.559362 |        0.009477 |      0.076149 |
|   **random-friend** |   0.059404 |   0.488519 |        0.076078 |      0.009497 |

The connections between outliers are way more common among politicians, as their outliers are probably other politicians in the same party.

### Ego clustering

We will use the following definition of clustering for directed networks, found in [**[5]**](#ref5):
$$
\text{EgoClustering}(G_u)=c_{u}=\frac{1}{\operatorname{deg}^{\operatorname{tot}}(u)\left(\operatorname{deg}^{\operatorname{tot}}(u)-1\right)-2 \operatorname{deg}^{\leftrightarrow}(u)} T(u)
$$
where $T(u)$ is the number of directed triangles through node $u$, $\operatorname{deg}^{\operatorname{tot}}(u)$ is the sum of in degree and out degree of $u$ and $\operatorname{deg}^{\leftrightarrow}(u)$ is the reciprocal degree of $u$.

<figure style="text-align:center">
    <iframe height='520' scrolling='no' src='../tfm-plots/networks-ego-clustering-type.html' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 99.99%;'>	</iframe>
    <figcaption>Fig.8 - Clustering score for ego-node.</figcaption>
</figure>


**P-values for sampled Kolmogorov-Smirnov test **

|                     | journalist | politician | random-follower | random-friend |
| ------------------: | ---------: | ---------: | --------------: | ------------: |
|      **journalist** |   0.014539 |   0.580375 |        0.110850 |      0.087493 |
|      **politician** |   0.579250 |   0.049219 |        0.664144 |      0.630919 |
| **random-follower** |   0.111391 |   0.664238 |        0.008437 |      0.036767 |
|   **random-friend** |   0.085648 |   0.631700 |        0.036911 |      0.008309 |

In fact the ego clustering and outlier connectedness are measuring a very similar thing, as in the graph, the ego has forward edges to all other nodes, and the more connections between outliers, the more triangles there will be through ego (more clustering).

## Evolving network

In this section we will measure the changes in the ego-network as the activity changes. We will split the timeline of the user into the temporal chunks ($\tau_i$) we found in the [linear breakpoints section]() in order to have stationarity in the data. We will then compute where is the outlier frontier for this temporal interval $\tau_i$ and divide it by the total retweeted amount  (${\sum_{v\in P_{\tau_i}}{R_u(v)}}$) during $\tau_i$, having as a result the proportion of retweets ($\sigma_{\tau_i}$) needed from a user to become outlier during $\tau_i$. Then we will input this proportion $\sigma_{\tau_i}$  in the weekly distribution of retweet counts ($P_j$), week by week during the breakpoints, we will get weekly outliers of the user. We will get a sense of stability of the network given the level of activity with the Jaccard index between a week outliers and the next week outliers. We will also compute.
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{for }  i &= 1\ldots \#breakpoints: \\

\sigma_{\tau_i}&=\frac{\text{OutlierFrontier}(P_{\tau_i})}{\sum_{v\in P_{\tau_i}}{R_u(v)}}\\
 T_i &\sim \text{Poisson}(\text{rate}=\lambda_i)\\
 &\text{for }  j = 1\ldots \#weeks: \\
 & \text{Outliers}'_{ij}(P_j)=\left\{o|\frac{R_u(o)}{\sum_{v\in P_j} R_u(v)}>\sigma_{\tau_i}\right\}
 \end{align*}
$$

In this framework we will compute the following features, for every week:

- Number of outliers: number of outliers that fall in the higher end of the frontier in the retweet counts per week.

- Number of new outliers: the number of new outliers that we haven't seen before in the previous weeks. This number will be higher at the beggining of the study, as we won't have seen that much profiles.

- Jaccard index: the Jaccard index is computed with the formula:
  $$
  J(\text{Outliers}'_{i,j},\text{Outliers}'_{i,j+1})=\frac{|\text{Outliers}'_{i,j}\cap\text{Outliers}'_{i,j+1}|}{|{Outliers}'_{i,j}\cup\text{Outliers}'_{i,j+1}|}
  $$
  It will give us a notion of stability in that week.

### Example

We will analyse the example of the congresswoman Inés Arrimadas from party Ciudadanos. In the period of time`15/08/2019-11/11/2019` we encounter the leader of the party nearly every week in its outliers, Albert Rivera. Then `11/11/2019` Albert Rivera, announces its retirement from politics and steps down as the leader party, other outliers become more important, and we can see how the Jaccard index decreases and the new outliers per week increases in the following months. But we also observe that in confinement period the behaviour of those variables changes a lot more than with the step down of the leader.

Example of the network evolution of Inés Arrimadas.

### Global analysis

We would like to see if the observed behaviour for our example can be also found in a global scale with all the users we have.

If we look at the overall picture of the Jaccard index, we see is very smoothed as we have a lot of users, but we can begin to see the a low value in the end of December and in the beginning of March. If we observe those dates in the number of outliers, we see two different behaviours, while in December we have less outliers per week, people probably retweeted less, and had less or no outliers in general in March we have a peak in the number of outliers. These two decreases in the Jaccard index have two different explanations: in march a lot of users retweeted a lot, and more outliers were found.

This phenomenon is amplified if we look only at politicians and journalist, probably because we have less profiles.
